These scripts validate that the core components work together before
the Agent class is implemented (Phase 5). They will be deleted after
Phase 5 is complete and proper e2e tests are written.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/scenarios/01_simple_conversation.py
    uv run python scripts/scenarios/02_single_tool_call.py
